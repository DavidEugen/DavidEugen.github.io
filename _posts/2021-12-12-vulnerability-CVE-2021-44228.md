## [log4shell Update] - 2021.12.15
Fixed in Log4j 2.12.2 and Log4j 2.16.0

## Mitigation
Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x is not impacted by this vulnerability.

Log4j 2.x mitigation: Implement one of the mitigation techniques below.

- Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.
- Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in progress, expected to be available soon).
- Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.
